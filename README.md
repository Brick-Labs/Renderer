# Renderer

This project aims to develop a real-time, cross-platform renderer focused on rendering digital bricks with high visual
quality and performance. The goal is to create a flexible rendering engine that can be integrated into different
applications in the future.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This renderer cannot be used independently, only with programs that make use of it.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Render building blocks models and write the output to a given imgae buffer
- [ ] 

### Non-Functional Requirements


## Setup
- Install Vulkan SDK from this [Website](https://vulkan.lunarg.com).
- Add this repo as submodule to the project `git submodule add https://github.com/Brick-Labs/Renderer.git` and clone submodules recursively `git submodule update --init --recursive`
